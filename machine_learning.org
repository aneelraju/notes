* Coursera: Machine Learning - Andrew Ng, Stanford University
** Week1
*** Introduction
    + Machine Learning 
      - Is a science of getting computers to learn, without being
        explicitly programmed
      - examples: 
        - database mining : web clicks, medical record, biology, engineering
        - applications can't code by hand : autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition, 
          natural language processing, computer vision
        - self-customizing programs : amazon, netflix
        - understanding human learning (brain, real AI)
    + supervised learning - "right answers" are given as data set
      + classification - discrete valued output (0,1,2...)
      + regression - continous value output
    + octave - open source high level interpreted language
      + used for rapid prototyping and then migrate to c++ and java
      + https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/

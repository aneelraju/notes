* Coursera: Machine Learning - Andrew Ng, Stanford University
** Week1
*** Introduction
    + Machine Learning 
      - Is a science of getting computers to learn, without being
        explicitly programmed
      - examples: 
        - database mining : web clicks, medical record, biology, engineering
        - applications can't code by hand : autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition, 
          natural language processing, computer vision
        - self-customizing programs : amazon, netflix
        - understanding human learning (brain, real AI)
    + supervised learning - "right answers" are given as data set
      + classification - discrete valued output (0,1,2...)
      + regression - continous value output
    + unsupervised learning - data doesn't have any label; find structure automatically
      + clustering - groups the data // news.google.com
      + eg:- organize computing clusters; social network analysis, market segmentation,
        astronomical data analysis
      + cocktail party problem algorithm // 2 microphone listens 2 speakers
        // one line algo:  [W,s,v] = svd((repmat(sum(x.*x,1),size(x,1),1).*x)*x');
        // svd - single value decomposition -> linear algebra routine built in ocative
      + with unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results   
    + octave - open source high level interpreted language
      + used for rapid prototyping and then migrate to c++ and java
      + https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/
    + prerequisite for this course
      + basic computer science principles and skills
      + basic probability theory
      + basic linear algebra
    + other matlab or octave are clojure, julia, python and R
    + sample problems or assignments link: http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html
